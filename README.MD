# About Me
I am a Software Engineering Student that is passionate about developing innovative user-centered designs. I am well-versed with the programming language python as well as the interface design tool Figma. With my growing knowledge on python and UI / UX design, I am capable of understanding fundamental concepts and languages.

I'm excited to apply my skills to real world challenges. I'm a detail oriented designer who enjoys collaborating with others to develop innovative solutions. I'm looking for opportunities to gain hands-on experience in the UI / UX design field and contribute to projects that make a difference.
